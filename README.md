A Discord bot done right. No bullshit like pay- or votewalls.

This is the rewrite for Kayano (now Tako). Before the rewrite it was written in JavaScript/Node.js with the Discord.js Library. But now it's written in Python with the discord.py Library. We have made some very great improvements and we hope you'll like it.

    TOKEN = "" # https://discord.com/developers/applications
    DB_NAME = "tako" # Or however you named your database
    DB_HOST = "localhost" # gonna be different if using a non-local database
    DB_PORT = 5432 # Optional port of the DB (Default: 5432)
    DB_USER = "postgres"
    DB_PASSWORD = ""

7. Sync commands
